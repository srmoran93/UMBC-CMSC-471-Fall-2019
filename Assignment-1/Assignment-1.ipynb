    "Uninformed Search (aka blind search) refers to the search strategies that do not use additional information about states and goal of the search - nothing beyond the provided problem definition. The first algorithms that we studied in Chapter 3 of the Russel & Norvig textbook were Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) which both fall into the category of Uniformed Search.  In the first part of this assignment, you will implement both BFS and DFS algorithms in Python and then test them on a simple graph and grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also studied how we can modify DFS to combine the advantages of BFS (completeness and conditional optimality) with the main advantage of DFS --space complexity of $O(bm)$ where $b$ is the branching factor and $m$ is the maximum depth of the search space. Limited Depth Search and Iterative Deepening DFS were two algorithms that we studied in that section and you are going to implement them in Part II of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pedagogically, this assignment will help you:\n",
    "- better understand how these algorithms work in pratice. \n",
    "- brush up your Python skills - and possibly learn a couple of new \"Pythonic\" tricks!\n",
    "- pratice reading documentation. This is a very important skill in AI/ML/Data Science collaborative environments and teams.\n",

    "  * `breadthFirstSearch(startState, goalState, successorsf)` \n",
    "  * `depthFirstSearch(startState, goalState, successorsf)`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Each receives as arguments the starting state, the goal state, and a successors function.  `breadthFirstSearch` returns the breadth-first solution path as a list of states starting with the `startState` and ending with the `goalState`.  `depthFirstSearch` returns the depth-first solution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference between BFS and DFS is the order they visit/expand and goal-test the nodes. They use a different mechanism for storing the nodes in memory. As discussed in the lectures, sections 3.3.1, 3.4.1 and Figure 3.11 of the textbook, BFS uses a FIFO strategy with a queue data structure and DFS uses a LIFO strategy with a stack data structure to pop the unexpanded nodes. Both FIFO and LIFO can be easily implemented in Python with a similar \"list\" data structure.\n",

    "**Iterative Deepening Search** - as discussed in the lectures - is similar to limited-depth search but incrementally increases the depth limit until it finds the goal. It combines the benefits of DFS (lower space complexity) with the benefits of BFS (completeness and conditional optimality). It gradually increases the depth limit until the goal is found and returns the solution path. It takes in as arguments the start state, goal state, actions functions, and the max depth. It cycles through the depths and runs a depth limited search using the parameters. If the goal is found, the solution path is returned. We also insert the start state for completeness. If the goal is not found, then the depth limit is increased by one iteratively until either the goal is found or a failure is returned. And a cutoff is returned if we reach the max depth without reaching the goal - you can set the max threshold to avoid long runtimes."
